# AI voice assistant 

AI voice assistant is a Python project for helping the users and execute the commands using user's voice, As a user you can talk to the assistant by just running the program and it will listen to what you're saying and answering the questions like:
* searching on the Wikipedia and reading to the user what was been found as result, 
* also it has a ability to do math calculation or distances, just by saying "calculate" or "compute". 
* In addition, it can also search for anything on YouTube by saying "search/find/look for on YouTube"
* also it can be asked to go to any website by saying "go to",
